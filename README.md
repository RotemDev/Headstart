# Headstart GHPages

This branch (`gh-pages`) is the website of [Headstart-CSS](https://roteminecraftil.github.io/Headstart).

Until the release of `v1.0.0`, the website will be a default gh-pages theme. When `v1.0.0` releases, the website
will be the main way of knowing what is headstart, and getting it.
