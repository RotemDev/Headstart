To use self-hosting:

<!-- JS file -->
<script src="SOON"></script>
```

## How to use icons
The icons are completely optional, and if you want them, you must include the `entypo.min.css` file (see install section above).

To use the icons, add a `<i>` or a `<span>` with `class="enpl-XXX"` when `XXX` is the icon name. <br>
For example:
``` html
<div class="col-3 success">
  <p><i class="enpl-chevron-right"></i> Example</p>
</div>
```
